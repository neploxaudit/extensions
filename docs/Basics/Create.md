# Creating Your Own Extension

It can also be very useful for testing for you to have the ability to create your own **extension**. In the next chapter, there will be a more detailed discussion of the structure of **extensions**; for now, you can download an example at [this link](https://github.com/slonser/simple-extension).

## Installation
First, go to **chrome://extensions**. Enable **Developer Mode** in the upper right corner.

After that, a "**Load Unpacked**" button will appear; click on it and select the folder of the previously downloaded **extension**.

Congratulations, you have installed your first custom **extension**!
