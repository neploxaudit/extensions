# Introduction

Welcome to our site dedicated to creating a **comprehensive knowledge base** on the security of **Chromium extensions**. 

As of now, there is no single resource that thoroughly addresses this important topic, despite the widespread use of extensions that interact with **sensitive data** and operations. Notably, extensions for **cryptocurrency wallets** and **password managers** exemplify this need for security awareness.

All attacks described on this resource use a threat model where the user visits the attacker's site.

# Contribute to Our Knowledge Base

This site is a compilation of my insights and knowledge gathered since the beginning of **2024**, through extensive experimentation with popular extensions. If you are interested in contributing material or sharing your expertise, please feel free to reach out to [me](https://x.com/slonser_). 

Your contributions can help enhance the **security landscape** for all users!
