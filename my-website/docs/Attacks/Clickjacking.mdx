# Clickjacking
This chapter is dedicated to Clickjacking in extension windows. I think it is unnecessary to explain what Clickjacking is; if you don't know, you can read about it in this [article](https://aszx87410.github.io/beyond-xss/en/ch5/clickjacking/). Here, we will consider the specifics of Clickjacking for extensions.

# ~~X-Frame-Options~~ web_accessible_resources
In the world of web applications, the ability to open a site in an iframe is regulated by X-Frame-Options or the CSP rule `frame-ancestors`. In the world of extensions, Chrome handles this with [web_accessible_resources](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/web-accessible-resources) in the manifest:
```JSON
    "web_accessible_resources": [ {
        "matches": [ "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ],
        "resources": [ "assets/example.js", "assets/test.js" ],
        "use_dynamic_url": false
     } ]
```
In fact, in the original situation, you cannot access an extension resource unless it is listed in `web_accessible_resources` (This cannot be done either with `fetch`, or with `iframe` and `window.open`).

However, there is a very important feature; suppose we have an extension with the following manifest:

```JSON
    "web_accessible_resources": [ {
        "matches": [ "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ],
        "resources": [ "assets/test.html" ],
        "use_dynamic_url": false
     } ]
```
Based on this manifest, we can open the `assets/test.html` page in an `iframe`. However, suppose `test.html` contains the following content:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Slonser</title>
    <script>
        const redirect_param = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('redirect');
        if (!new URL(redirect_param).origin != origin) {
            window.location.href = redirect_param;
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
This code allows for a redirect to any extension page, and we will still have the link.

In simple terms, `web_accessible_resources` only regulates the initial page opening of the extension; if it performs a redirect, we will continue to have access to the window.

:::tip Note
This is very important, as an Open Redirect on a window that does not provide benefits from Clickjacking can allow you to perform Clickjacking on a window with settings, cryptocurrency transfers, etc.
:::
## history.back()
Another good technique for obtaining a reference to the window is to redirect to your window! Suppose you managed to get the popup window of the extension to execute:
```javascript
window.open(YOUR_SITE)
```
Then you will need to create 2 documents on your site:
1.html:
```html
<script>
window.open('/2.html','_blank','location=yes,height=570,width=520,scrollbars=yes,status=yes')
window.history.back()
</script>
```
2.html:
```html
<script>
    console.log("Now you have a reference to the extension window")
</script>
```
Now you have a link to the window (which allows you, for example, to send `postMessage` to it), and you also have the ability to clickjacking.

You can also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnI0w156rtw) if you are not familiar with clickjacking, it well demonstrates the impact of clickjacking in extensions.
